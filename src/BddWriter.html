                      Then The devices do API checks in to receive commands with parameters as follows:
                            | DeviceIds                              | Command          |  Parameters                                                                                       |
                            | &ltDeviceRefId&gt                          | InstallProfile   |                                                                                                   |
                      And The status of the device profile is as follows:   
                            | ProfileName                                | DeviceId      | Status    |
                            | &ltProfileName&gt                              | &ltDeviceRefId&gt | Installed |

                      Examples:
                      | DeviceRefId          | ProfileName                      | DeviceName         | RuleName                                 | DeviceFamilyQualification|
                      | DeviceId.{guid}      | Dev_New_{{feature}}AfterUpgrade.{guid}      | Dev_New_{{feature}}1.{guid}   | Dev_{{feature}}_New_AfterUpgradeRule1.{guid}        | AppleMACDevice           |
                      | UserId.{guid}        | User_New_{{feature}}AfterUpgrade.{guid}     | User_New_{{feature}}1.{guid}  | User_{{feature}}_New+AfterUpgradeRule2.{guid}       | AppleMACUser             |
